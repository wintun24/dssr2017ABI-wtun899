# Vision
### **To understand how the placental blood flow and shear stress contribute in placental pathology, especially in intra-uterine growth restriction. This will be useful for prevention and treatment of IUGR in the future.**

# Mission
### 1. Study the morphological difference in placental vascular structure between normal and IUGR 
### 2. Predict the placental vascular shear stress in normal and IUGR placental vessel
### 3. Conduct the laboratory experiment to test morphological and functional changes of placental endothelial cells under predicted shear stress

# Success Creteria
### Study vascular tree structure from 2D and 3D images
### Modify the normal placental model into IUGR model
### Figure out how shear stress influence endothelial cell morphology and functions

# Team agreement
### * Clear communication 
### * Set a definitive goal
### * Share the knowledge 
### * Weekly meeting

# Project Team 
### Conduct different projects on placental relate disorders
### Weekly meeting and discuss the plan for the week ahead
